        <article class="article" id="difference">
          <h2 class="article__title">Difference between BVoc BFSI and BBA or B.COM</h2>
          <p>
            Why should I do BVoc BFSI instead of BBA finance or B.Com? What is the difference
            between both of them? A BBA student will learn theory about finance and banking sitting
            in a classroom. Many students who pass the exam don’t even know how to fill up a cheque.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, a BVoc BFSI student will learn from the classroom for 2 hours and
            then he will go for an internship in a company. Students will gain practical experience
            from the company, so after completing BVoc that student will have 3 years of experience
            with a bachelor’s degree. On the other hand BBA finance or B.Com students just have a
            degree with no practical experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            As BVoc is a Bachelor’s degree you can also do a masters after it. Let’s say both BVoc
            finance and BBA finance students have done masters. Still, a BBA finance student is
            considered as a fresher whereas a BVoc Finance student will have a minimum 3-5 years of
            experience + BVoc degree + Master's degree.
          </p>
          <p>
            When both of them appear for an interview, who do you think will have a chance of
            getting selected? BVoc student with degrees and experience or BBA student with just a
            degree? There is a higher chance that BVoc students will get selected.

        <article class="article" id="demand">
          <h2 class="article__title">How much demand is there After doing BVoc BFSI</h2>
          <p>
            Finance comes under the top 3 most demanded career options after management and IT. As
            you know, a lot of companies are entering the finance sector. Some companies you might
            recall are PayTM, Google pay, Phone pay, Bharat pay etc. Many credit cards are issues
            like Fino or One card.
          </p>
          <p>
            All these Financial institutes require Finance employees to run their company. You will
            see a lot of demand for a finance student in the market from these companies and the
            demand of this sector is going to increase in future.
