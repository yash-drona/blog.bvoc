                students know that there is one of the best degrees after class 12, its name is

              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>

                from other degrees? Where does B.Voc take place? You have to get all this
                information in this Blog. It is a very short Blog, if you want to see more details
                scroll through the entire blogs of Drona Foundation or Visit our Youtube Channel (
                @DronaFoundationGujrat )
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                You will find heaps of B.Voc blogs but in this we want to give you all the
                information about B.Voc degree in a very short blog so let's have a look about what
                is B.Voc?. B.Voc is just a bachelor degree.It is also same as B.Com or B.Sc or B.A.
                This is also a three-year bachelor's degree.
              </p>

              <!-- TODO: Use JavaScript to get the year count -->
              <p>
                UGC has started B.Voc in 2013-14 many people think it is a very new degree, no it
                has been 10 years since it was started in 2013-14 but very few students and parents
                know but after the National Education Policy 2020 this degree has got a tremendous
                boost. Let me tell you that before this National Education Policy, there were 200
                colleges in the whole country.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Within a month of the coming of the National Education Policy, 1500 colleges in the
                whole country have started B.Voc, so you can understand how much emphasis has been
                placed on B.Voc, Government want that 50% from 3 crore and 85 lakh of the students
                studying in the whole country should do B.Voc.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I'm repeating that 3 crore 85 lakh students are studying in the whole country who
                are doing BA, B.Com, B.Sc, BBA. If the government says in the new education policy
                that 50% of the students should do B.Voc. You can understand how important this
                course will be. It is based on Germany's dual weight system. You may have heard a
                lot abroad that Students earn and pay their own expenses while studying.

            B.Voc Specializations / How Many Types of Specializations can be done in B.Voc?
          </h2>
          <p>
            But now you will have a question about how many specializations can be done in some
            fields. There are about 65 specializations in B.Voc but in Gujarat we run programs of
            Drona Foundation in many colleges out of which you can do B.Voc in eight specializations
            in different fields.
          </p>

          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              <p>
                First is <em>Management and Entrepreneurship</em> as BBA is a management course. If
                you want to become a manager or want to start your own business or already have a
                family business and want to add value to that business you can do a B.Voc in
                management and entrepreneurship.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Another one is <em>B.Voc Information Technology</em> which is done by any student
                who is looking for B.C.A, BSC IT then similarly now B.Voc Information Technology if
                you want to make a career in computer field you can do it,also if you want to make a
                career in software development.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                One who wants to make a career in banking or financial services, or have to work
                with a chartered accountant. To make a career in auditing, in future CA, CFA want to
                do that, then all those students can do <em>B.voc banking and finance</em>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Another great specialization is Ayurvedic Health Care Hospital Management and
                Patient Care Management that Science students can pursue. The funny thing is that
                till now Commerce and Arts students could not pursue a career in Medical.And now if
                you are a student of arts and commerce in medical and want to make a career in the
                medical field then you can do
                <em> B.Voc health care or hospital management or patient care management course </em
                >.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Another great course is <em>B.Voc Design Fundamentals</em> If you want to advance
                your career in Graphics Designing or Interior Designing or Fashion Designing then
                B.Voc Design Fundamentals is a great course at less cost than Bachelor of Design BS.

              <p>
                Whether you want to be a radio jockey, a video jockey, a news TV anchor, a YouTuber,
                or a journalist in the future,
                <em>Media Journalism and Mass Communication B.Voc</em> is for all students who are
                interested in this.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                If you are a foodie or you want to start any food related dairy or bakery or
                something like that then you can do agro processing food processing your background
                is farming and you feel that I need to add value and do better business. Then you
                can do <em>B.Voc in food processing, agro processing</em>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Your background is in farming and you feel that I want to add value and further do a
                better business, you can do food processing, agro processing. If you have your own
                farm, then you can do B.Voc Natural Farming or Organic Farming, now the demand of
                organic is increasing tremendously, the prices of organic products are double than
                what you get for normal products, so those who want to do can do
                <em> B.Voc Organic Farming or Natural Farming </em>.

            Why B.Voc?/How is B.Voc different from other bachelor degrees?
          </h2>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              <p>
                You may be wondering why we have to do B.Voc?, There are degree for this all
                specializations like BSc Agriculture, B.Sc Organic Farming, BBA Finance, BSc
                Banking, Finance or B.Com, BSc Management, Bachelor of Journalism Mass, same common
                thing in that the traditional degrees till date were theory based.This all degree
                are focusing on theory and bookish knowledge and B.Voc is focusing on theory as well
                as practical knowledge.The students of B.Voc have on the job trainings and live
                projects.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                In other degrees you have to go to college for 6 hours sitting in class and studying
                your particular course or rather if you are pursuing B.Voc, students have to attend
                class only for 2 hours and have to do internships or on the job training for 6 hours
                in companies which are related to particular specialization.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If you are doing B.Voc in Organic Farming than 60 percent you have to spend time on
                Organic Farm .If you do B.Voc in finance then you have to spend 60 percent of your
                time in a Chartered Accountant or Bank DSA. If you do B.Voc in management then you
                have to spend time in any management related company marketing, real estate, retail
                company.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Why B.Voc is important if you want to learn swimming, If someone teach you all day
                in the classroom PPT or by taking you to industrial visit i.e. visit swimming pool
                and show the swimming pool than you make a project report on swimming pool, Finally
                at the end of the semester you get 100 out of 100 marks in the exam, you have only
                knowledge swimming.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                But if you want to learn swimming actually then you have to do swimming, if you want
                to swim then you have to actually jump into the swimming pool you can't learn
                swimming just from theory then similarly in management, finance, software
                development or communication, How can you do all these things, this was the big
                problem of our education system till now.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Students had only theoretical knowledge. Practicing knowledge was nothing. In the
                name of practical knowledge we do project reports of industrial visits but never do
                actual practice. When we go to do that practice after studying, people tell us that
                you are a fresher, when people tell you that, what you have studied is of no use to
                come here, something else is going on.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                To prevent this from happening, the government has started a B.Voc degree. Because
                traditional courses are based on just theoretical knowledge, more than 50% of the
                graduates are unemployed, and most of the students are struggling with B.B.A., B.Com
                or B.Sc. Now what is the point of doing business or job doing something different
                because the field in which he got his degree doesn't work.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                That knowledge has no meaning, so that this does not happen, B.Voc of has been
                started, you have to do B.Voc from the very first year i.e. from the first semester
                or from the second semester you have to start working in the companies of the field
                you want to go to or actually in a field.
              </p>

        <article class="article">
          <h2 class="article__title">What are the Benefits of B.Voc?</h2>
          <em data-size="large">
            Education (Theory) + Experience (Practical) = Earning (Job + Stipend)
          </em>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              <p>
                If you really do it, we have seen our record of students who do B.Voc, but 80% of
                the students have earned back the fees that they have paid for 3 years from the
                stipends only which is given by the companies where they are doing internships. Yes,
                you may not earn from the first year, but from the second year you will start
                earning slowly and by the third year, you will get back the amount of fees you have
                paid in three years. Government has brought such a great course.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Here you wear formal clothes, you pay fees in college and many students will create
                excitement that yes, when you go to the company, you can do internships, you can get
                money, you can earn and pay your fees from it, this is the only degree that Which
                can increase your bank balance with just your knowledge and experience.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                An example you can also consider BCA and B.Voc IT student For the IT the field, BCA
                student will study theory for three years just like any other traditional course but
                here B.Voc student for three years will learn theory as well as daily internship in
                a finance company,in Bank DSA and will get to work.And now BCA student is a fresher,
                he has no experience, he will go to get a job and there is 3 crore 85 lakh students
                are searching for jobs, and B.Voc student has completed 3 years of graduation with 3
                years of live experience in company.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                You can know what this 3 year difference in your professional life is.If someone has
                done MBA and has three years of experience, look at it and ask what was the
                condition of your career three years ago and what is the condition after three years
                of experience. These 3 years make a huge difference.We will get a good job if we
                study for another 2 years after doing B.A.and in front of B.Voc student also do MBA,
                Executive MBA or M.Voc now how does Executive MBA and M.Voc also happen Same you
                just have to study 40% theory and 60% going to company now he has three years so he
                will get to do full time job, where is this student after doing full time job and
                who is mba student again he is MBA fresher again go back for job.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                And this student has a B.Voc plus MBA and five years of banking and finance
                experience. Now think about it, if both people go to the bank for an interview, who
                will be selected first and if both of them are to be selected, who will be given the
                higher salary. Obviously the person with experience will come, that's why B.Voc
                becomes very necessary.That's why the government is pushing B.Voc a lot and that's
                why B.Voc has been given a lot of priority in the new education policy.
