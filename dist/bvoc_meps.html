            Difference between BVoc MEPS( Management and entrepreneurship ) and BBA or B.COM
          </h2>
          <p>
            Now a student is doing BBA marketing and on the other hand a student doing BVoc
            marketing. Then what will be the difference? The BBA student learns about the market by
            sitting in a classroom for 3 years while a BVoc student learns marketing in Classroom
            and in a company.
          </p>
          <p>
            It might sound funny to hear learn marketing by sitting in a classroom. If you want to
            learn marketing, you have to do actual marketing, you have to convince someone, explain
            the product to someone, or if you want to do digital marketing, you have to promote a
            product on Facebook, Instagram and other platforms. If you are less interested in
            learning theory and you want to get some practical experience then you can join BVoc and
            get placed in a retail company for 3 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            After three years, the student who has completed BBA Marketing will be a fresher while
            BVoc student will have three years of experience in marketing or management with a
            bachelor degree. Now BBA students think of doing MBA to get a good job. He studied MBA
            for 2 years and is still considered a fresher. On the other hand if any Bvoc student do
            masters in MBA or MVoc then he will have minimum 3-5 years of experience as compared to
            the student doing BBA.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 5 years, The BBA student only completed his 3 years in bachelor's and 2 years in
            master’s, but still he is fresher with a degree. On the other hand a BVoc student will
            have BVoc + MBA + five years of marketing experience. When both of them appear for an
            interview for any management position who do you think will get the preference? The one
            with the experience right! That is why a BVoc degree is way better for management as
            compared to BBA or BCom.

          <h2 class="article__title">
            How much demand is there After doing BVoc Management and Entrepreneurship
          </h2>
          <p>
            We would say that management and entrepreneurship are the most in demand because you
            cannot imagine running an organization without management. Management is required in
            every field from Hospital to Education institute to Real Estate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Political organizations like BJP, Congress or Aam Aadmi Party also need marketing and
            management to sustain. Whether you are in the education field or the e-commerce field
            there will always be demand for management people and that is the reason why you should
            go for a management career.
