            Difference between BVoc in Agro/Food Processing and Bsc agriculture?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The biggest difference between BVoc and BSc is experience. In Bsc agriculture you will
            learn from the classroom, whereas in BVoc you will work in a food or agro processing
            unit. If you want to start your own startup then you will have experience about how the
            food and agro business operates.
          </p>
          <p>
            When both students apply for a job in any company then BVoc students will come for an
            interview with 3 years of experience. There are higher chances of a BVoc student to get
            selected because of his experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are hard working and have relevant skills then you can also earn from 1st
            semester. Many BVoc students pay their day-to-day expenses themselves and some also pay
            their fees on their own.

            How much demand is there After doing BVoc Agro / food Processing?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Should I do BVoc in Agro/food Processing? Does it have any future in India? Are there
            any jobs for this? I know you will have all these questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Food is the most important and basic necessity. We all remembered Covid 19! All the
            businesses were closed but the food business was still running because itâ€™s a basic
            necessity. So even in the worst situation food business is not going to stop.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can start your own food start-up or else you can work in any bakery or dairy
            business.
