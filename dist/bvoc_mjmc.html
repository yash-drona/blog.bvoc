            Difference between BVoc Media, Journalism and Mass Communication MJMC and BJMC
          </h2>
          <p>
            So what is the difference between general BA or BJMC (Bachelor of Journalism & Mass
            Communication) and BVoc MJMC (Media, Journalism and mass communication). Both of them
            are degrees of Mass media and journalism, but students of BJMC only study in the
            classroom having theoretical knowledge for 3 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whereas the BVoc student has to attend class for 2 hours in the morning and after that
            they have to go for internships or on the job training provided by us. They gain actual
            3 years of live experience working in the media companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 3 years when both the students go for job interviews, BJMC student is a fresher
            with bachelor degree while BVoc student has 3 years of work experience with bachelor's
            degree.The demand of BVoc students is more because they already know how the companies
            work and they also have professionalism in them.
