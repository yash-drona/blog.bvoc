            Why is BVoc MEPS (Management and Entrepreneurship) better than other traditional
            courses?
          </h2>
          <p>
            More than 50% of students after doing such traditional degrees are unemployed or change
            their line and get half-time jobs. 3 crore 85 lakh students are currently studying all
            over India, so if you want to do something different and get a better degree in
            management field, then you can go for BVoc. With any business related to management or
            real estate or retail, you have to start working from the very first year and that's why
            this degree is very important because it gives you experience from the very first year.
          </p>
          <p>
            In traditional courses like BBA, B.Com you have to study 100% theory management by
            sitting in the classroom all day, while in B.Voc students are studying 40% in the
            classroom and 60% doing some management related internships.They actually go to a
            company and do marketing, finance, management and also sometimes HR position. You will
            get management education in the classroom and actual management experience in the
            company.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are a student in college and in a company you are a management executive, in college
            you pay a fee, you go to company and do just telly calling Even if you make calls, even
            if you do data entry, you will get stipend of 3000/month which means 36000 for 12
            months. If you get even 3000 then you can pay your fees on your own and that is the aim
            of B.Voc.

            Difference between BVoc MEPS( Management and entrepreneurship ) and BBA or B.COM
          </h2>
          <p>
            Now a student is doing BBA marketing and on the other hand, a student is doing BVoc
            marketing then what will be the difference if a BBA student learns about the market by
            sitting in a classroom for 3 years and a Bvoc student learning marketing in Classroom
            and in a company .It might become ridiculous how you can learn marketing by sitting in a
            classroom. If you want to learn marketing, you have to do actual marketing, you have to
            convince someone, you have to explain the product to someone, or if you want to do
            digital marketing, you have to promote a product on Facebook, Instagram and other
            platforms. If you don't want to learn theory and you want to take some practical
            experience then the student gets placed in a retail company for 3 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            After three years, this student has done BBA Marketing, but he will be a fresher while
            B.Voc student will have three years of experience in marketing or banking or management,
            and he has also done bachelor degree now this student thinks that let me still do MBA in
            marketing then I will get a good job. He studies MBA for 1–2 years and will still be
            considered fresher on the other hand if any Bvoc student do masters in MBA or MVoc then
            he will have minimum 3-5 years of experience as compared to the student doing BBA.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 5 years, this student is doing MBA again and is a freelancer. While this student
            is B. Voc + MBA + five years of retail management marketing experience. He has
            experience in banking, if these two people go to any company for the position of
            management, there is a post of general manager or there is a post of junior manager. Who
            will get the job first, the fresher or the one who has five years of experience? That is
            why this degree is way better for management.

            Is there any Demand for BVoc MEPS (Management and entrepreneurship) in future.
          </h2>
          <p>
            We would say that management and entrepreneurship are the most in demand because you
            cannot manage anything without management. Moreover if in hospital, then it also needs
            management. If it is an education institute, it also needs management. If it is a real
            estate company, it also needs management.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there is a political organization, whether you belong to BJP or Congress or Aam Aadmi
            Party, marketing and management finance accounting are everywhere. Whether you are in
            the education field or the e-commerce field, in short you will go to any organization,
            there will always be the demand of management people and that is the reason why you
            should go for a management career so in this career you have scope in any field.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't want to work, you can join your existing family business and you can
            professionally understand how to take your family business further by pursuing a degree
            in management and entrepreneurship. You can start your own startup. You can give UPSC,
            GPSC staff selection, commission, IBPS, such government exams even if you haven’t
            cleared the government exam after doing B.Voc management you can make a career in sales
            and marketing, operations management i.e. back office or admin, human resource
            management, finance, banking or any other industry where the job is from a tele caller
            to a small receptionist to a data entry operator to a CEO.
