                students know that there is one of the best degrees after class 12, its name is
                Bachelor of Vocation (B.Voc).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                So what is B.Voc? Why is it best?Why should we have to do B.voc? How is it different
                from other degrees? Where does B.Voc take place? You have to get all this
                information in this Blog. It is a very short Blog, if you want to see more details
                scroll through the entire blogs of Drona Foundation or Visit our Youtube Channel (
                @DronaFoundationGujrat )
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                You will find heaps of B.Voc blogs but in this we want to give you all the
                information about B.Voc degree in a very short blog so let's have a look about what
                is B.Voc?. B.Voc is just a bachelor degree.It is also same as B.Com or B.Sc or B.A.
                This is also a three-year bachelor's degree.
              </p>

              <p>
                UGC has started B.Voc in 2013-14 many people think it is a very new degree, no it
                has been 10 years since it was started in 2013-14 but very few students and parents
                know but after the National Education Policy 2020 this degree has got a tremendous
                boost. Let me tell you that before this National Education Policy, there were 200
                colleges in the whole country.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Within a month of the coming of the National Education Policy, 1500 colleges in the
                whole country have started B.Voc, so you can understand how much emphasis has been
                placed on B.Voc, Government want that 50% from 3 crore and 85 lakh of the students
                studying in the whole country should do B.Voc.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I'm repeating that 3 crore 85 lakh students are studying in the whole country who
                are doing BA, B.Com, B.Sc, BBA. If the government says in the new education policy
                that 50% of the students should do B.Voc. You can understand how important this
                course will be. It is based on Germany's dual weight system. You may have heard a
                lot abroad that Students earn and pay their own expenses while studying.

            B.Voc Specializations/How Many Types of Specializations can be done in B.Voc?
          </h2>
          <p>
            But now you will have a question about how many specializations can be done in some
            fields. There are about 65 specializations in B.Voc but in Gujarat we run programs of
            Drona Foundation in many colleges out of which you can do B.Voc in eight specializations
            in different fields.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                First is <em>Management and Entrepreneurship</em> as BBA is a management course. If
                you want to become a manager or want to start your own business or already have a
                family business and want to add value to that business you can do a B.Voc in
                management and entrepreneurship.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Another one is <em>B.Voc Information Technology</em> which is done by any student
                who is looking for B.C.A, BSC IT then similarly now B.Voc Information Technology if
                you want to make a career in computer field you can do it,also if you want to make a
                career in software development.

                One who wants to make a career in banking or financial services, or have to work
                with a chartered accountant. To make a career in auditing, in future CA, CFA want to
                do that, then all those students can do <em>B.voc banking and finance</em>.

                Another great specialization is Ayurvedic Health Care Hospital Management and
                Patient Care Management that Science students can pursue. The funny thing is that
                till now Commerce and Arts students could not pursue a career in Medical.And now if
                you are a student of arts and commerce in medical and want to make a career in the
                medical field then you can do
