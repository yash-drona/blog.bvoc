          <h2 class="article__title">Who should do BVoc in Design</h2>
          <p>
            Students who think Accounting, banking, finance, IT management are not careers. I want
            to do something creative, people who can make the best out of waste, people whose
            creative thinking, artistic value, drawing and design are very good, if you are one of
            those students then you will find it a very exciting career than all other boring
            careers. It will be fun to do because this itself is a design career.
          </p>

            What is the difference between Bachelor of Design and BVoc Design?
          </h2>
          <p>
            What is the difference between Bachelor of Design and BVoc Design? In Bachelor of Design
            you will study in college and classroom. But in BVoc Design it has classroom study as
            well as you have to work on a live project in a design company or as a Intern in a
            designing company.
          </p>
          <p>
            So after three years a Bachelor of Design student may be a fresher but a BVoc design
            student will not be a fresher, he will also have three years of design experience and
            therefore his employability will increase or even if he wants to do START UP himself
            then he will have the experience and knowledge to start one.
          </p>

          <h2 class="article__title">What is the benefit of BVoc design?</h2>
          <p>
            Anyone can take admission after 12th standard, you don't need to give NATA, NID, NIFT
            entrance exam. Many times students spend lakhs of rupees in preparation for entrance and
            still don't pass. You can take direct entry in this B.Voc Design is a three-year
            bachelor degree six semester course this bachelor degree is like other bachelor courses
            like BA, BSC, BCom.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you can do really good designing from the first year then you can also do stipend.
            Again design is a creative business so if even if you got less in 12th we would accept
            you. It is always tried in B.Voc that you earn while you are studying.
