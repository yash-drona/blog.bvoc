            What is the difference between Bachelor of Design and BVoc Design?
          </h2>
          <p>
            What is the difference between Bachelor of Design and BVoc Design? In Bachelor of Design
            you will study in classroom. But in BVoc Design it includes classroom study as well as
            you have to work on a live project in a design company or as a Intern in a designing
            company.
          </p>
          <p>
            So after three years a Bachelor of Design student may be a fresher but a BVoc design
            student will not be a fresher, he will have three years of design experience and
            therefore his employability will increase or even if he wants to do a START UP then he
            will have the experience and knowledge to start one.

                In the 21st century all the companies are moving towards design thinking. What is
                design thinking? If you show the customer some good and attractive things then you
                will convince the customer to make a purchase.

                If you purchase a mobile phone then you don’t only see its processor and camera but
                also consider its look. Same applies in clothing industry. You see how clothes look
                on you, just wearing clothes means nothing to anyone so people are attracted by the
                look or design of anything and now all the companies have come to know that.

                If there is a game that has good graphics you would choose that game to play. The
                cars that we purchase, do we just see features of the car? NO. We also see the
                design of the car and that’s why people are ready to pay crores for a Lamborghini.

                Automobile companies know very well that every company is now focusing on design and
                you can make a career going forward in all these companies in the 21st century now.
