            Difference between BVoc natural/organic Farming and B.Sc Agriculture.
          </h2>
          <p>
            In B.Sc agriculture students are given theoretical knowledge by sitting in a classroom
            for 3 years. Maybe after completing the course when they actually work in the field they
            won’t know the basics of farming. Farming is purely practical. It is very difficult to
            learn farming sitting in a classroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            While on the other hand students of Bvoc natural farming have spent 60% of their time on
            the actual farm. They gain the experience and knowledge from classroom study and
            practical experience by actually working on the farm.

            How much demand is there After doing BVoc Natural/Organic Farming
          </h2>
          <p>
            As we know India is known for producing and exporting Organic food products. Also after
            Covid-19 the demand for Organic products has increased because of this rising demand the
            price and profits are also rising. Foreign countries give employment to people who know
            about organic farming.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Foreign countries companies have tons of land to grow organic food, but there's no
            expert who knows about organic farming. So the demand for organic farming doesn’t only
            limit to India but also excess to Foreign countries.
