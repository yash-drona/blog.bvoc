            Why is BVoc Healthcare management better than other traditional courses?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Today we are going to talk about a degree through which commerce and arts students can
            go into medical and health care fields. Any Commerce, Arts or Science student can do
            this degree called BVoc (Bachelor Of Vocation) in health care.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let me give you the basic information about BVoc healthcare. This is also a bachelor
            degree like bsc nursing, but this is not a pure medical course like MBBS or BDS or BHMS,
            BAMS you are not going to become a doctor or a typical nurse. This is more of a health
            care hospital management, if you want to make your career in the medical field then this
            is the subject for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have done a course in hospital management, health care management, patient care
            management, you can make yourself from receptionist to CEO of the hospital. You can
            become HR Manager, Marketing Manager, Hospital Manager, General Manager in a hospital
            and the scope of this degree keeps increasing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now why should I do Bvoc rather than doing other traditional courses? That's because we
            provide knowledge in 40% theory and 60% practical format. You have to go to a hospital
            and work there to gain practical experience. You will get education in a classroom and
            you will get training in a company, as a student you will get the opportunity to work as
            an executive in the company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Health care is a bit tricky career in that you may have to take a lot of time to develop
            skills in the beginning, it may happen that you don't expect a stipend for one and a
            half year but yes, you may start earning a stipend from the second or third year. You
            can pay your own fees once you start earning.
