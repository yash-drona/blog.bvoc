                other degrees? Where does BVoc take place? You have to get all this information in

                You will find heaps of BVoc blogs but in this we want to give you all the
                information about BVoc degree in a very short blog, so let's have a look about what
                is BVoc? BVoc is just a bachelor degree which is done after class 12th. It is also
                the same as B.Com or B.Sc or B.A. This is also a three-year bachelor's degree.
              </p>

            <!-- TODO: Use JavaScript to get the year count -->
            <li>
              <p>
                UGC has started BVoc in 2013-14 many people think it is a very new degree. No, it
                has been 10 years since it was started in 2013-14 but very few students and parents
                know but after the National Education Policy 2020 this degree has got a tremendous
                boost. Let me tell you that before this National Education Policy, there were 200
                colleges in the whole country.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Within a month of implementation of the National Education Policy, 1500 colleges in
                the whole country have started BVoc, so you can understand how much emphasis has
                been placed on BVoc. Government wants 50% students that are 3 crore and 85 lakh
                students studying in the whole country should do BVoc.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I'm repeating that 3 crore 85 lakh students are studying in the whole country who
                are doing BA, B.Com, B.Sc, BBA, etc. If the government says in the new education
                policy that 50% of the students should do BVoc. You can understand how important
                this course will be. It is based on Germany's dual weight system. You may have heard
                a lot about how students abroad earn and pay their own expenses while studying.

          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              The candidates should have passed the 10+2/12th examination or an equivalent
              examination.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is no mandatory cutoff score, but it depends on universities. Some put cutoffs
              of 50-55% but some colleges have no cutoffs system.
            </li>
            <li>
              Candidates having a diploma degree after Matric qualification are also eligible.

          <p>
            But now you will have a question about how many specializations can be done in some
            fields. There are about 65 specializations in BVoc but in Gujarat we run programs of
            Drona Foundation in many colleges out of which you can do BVoc in eight specializations
            in different fields.

          <h2 class="article__title">Difference between BVoc and all other degrees?</h2>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              <p>
                You may be wondering why we have to do BVoc? There are degrees for all
                specializations like BSc Agriculture, B.Sc Organic Farming, BBA Finance, BSc
                Banking, Finance or B.Com, BSc Management, Bachelor of Journalism Mass, the same
                common thing is that the traditional degrees till date were theory based. This all
                degree is focused on theory and bookish knowledge and BVoc is focusing on theory as
                well as practical knowledge. The students of BVoc have on the job training and live
                projects.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                In other degrees you have to go to college for 6 hours sitting in class and studying
                your particular course or rather if you are pursuing BVoc, students have to attend
                class only for 2 hours and have to do internships or on the job training for 6 hours
                in companies which are related to particular specialization.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If you are doing BVoc in Organic Farming then you have to spend 60 percent of your
                time in organic farms .If you do BVoc in finance then you have to spend 60 percent
                of your time in a Chartered Accountant or Bank DSA (Direct selling agent). If you do
                a BVoc in management, then you have to spend time in any management related company:
                marketing, real estate, retail company.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Why is BVoc important? Let's say you want to learn swimming, If someone teach you
                all day in the classroom PPT or by taking you to industrial visit i.e. visit
                swimming pool and show the swimming pool than you make a project report on swimming
                pool, Finally at the end of the semester you get 100 out of 100 marks in the exam,
                you have only knowledge swimming.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                But if you want to learn swimming actually then you have to do swimming, if you want
                to swim then you have to actually jump into the swimming pool you can't learn
                swimming just from theory then similarly in management, finance, software
                development or communication, How can you do all these things, this was the big
                problem of our education system till now.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Students had only theoretical knowledge. Practicing knowledge was nothing. In the
                name of practical knowledge, we do project reports of industrial visits but never do
                actual practice. When we go for job interviews after studying, people tell us that
                you are a fresher, when people tell you that what you have studied is of no use to
                come here, something else is going on.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                To prevent this from happening, the government has started a BVoc degree. Because
                traditional courses are based on just theoretical knowledge, more than 50% of the
                graduates are unemployed, and most of the students are struggling with a B.B.A.,
                B.Com or B.Sc. Now what is the point of doing business or a job doing something
                different because he doesn't have skills to work in the field in which he got his
                degree.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                That knowledge has no meaning, BVoc has been started to solve this problem, when you
                do Bvoc you have to do internship/job from the very first year i.e. from the first
                semester or from the second semester you have to start working in the companies in
                the field you want to go to or actually in the field.

          <h2 class="article__title">What are the Benefits of BVoc?</h2>
          <em data-size="large">
            Education (Theory) + Experience (Practical) = Earning (Job + Stipend)

          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              <p>
                If you really do it, we have seen our record of students who do BVoc, but 80% of the
                students have earned back the fees that they have paid for 3 years from the stipends
                only which is given by the companies where they are doing internships. Yes, you may
                not earn from the first year, but from the second year you will start earning slowly
                and by the third year, you will get back the amount of fees you have paid in three
                years. Government has brought such a great course.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Here you wear formal clothes, you pay fees in college and many students will create
                excitement that yes, when you go to the company, you can do internships, you can get
                money, you can earn and pay your fees from it, this is the only degree that can
                increase your bank balance with just your knowledge and experience.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                An example you can also consider BCA and B.Voc IT student For the IT field, BCA
                student will study theory for three years just like any other traditional course but
                here BVoc student for three years will learn theory as well as daily internship in a
                finance company,in Bank DSA (Direct selling agent) and will get to work. And now BCA
                student is a fresher, he has no experience, he will go to get a job and there are 3
                crore 85 lakh students searching for jobs, and B.Voc student has completed 3 years
                of graduation with 3 years of live experience in company.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                You can know what this 3 year difference in your professional life is.If someone has
                done MBA and has three years of experience, look at it and ask what was the
                condition of your career three years ago and what is the condition after three years
                of experience. These 3 years make a huge difference. After completing 2 years of
                Masters they only have theoretical knowledge and no practical experience. On the
                other hand Bvoc students will have 3 years of practical experience and can showcase
