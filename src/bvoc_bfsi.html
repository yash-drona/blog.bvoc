          <h2 class="article__title">Difference between BVoc BFSI and BBA or B.COM</h2>
          <p>
            Why should I do BVoc BFSI instead of BBA finance or B.Com? What is the difference
            between both of them? A BBA student will learn theory about finance and banking sitting
            in a classroom. Many students who pass the exam don’t even know how to fill up a cheque.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, a BVoc BFSI student will learn from the classroom for 2 hours and
            then he will go for an internship in a company. Students will gain practical experience
            from the company, so after completing BVoc that student will have 3 years of experience
            with a bachelor’s degree. On the other hand BBA finance or B.Com students just have a
            degree with no practical experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            As BVoc is a Bachelor’s degree you can also do a masters after it. Let’s say both BVoc
            finance and BBA finance students have done masters. Still, a BBA finance student is
            considered as a fresher whereas a BVoc Finance student will have a minimum 3-5 years of
            experience + BVoc degree + Master's degree.
          </p>
          <p>
            When both of them appear for an interview, who do you think will have a chance of
            getting selected? BVoc student with degrees and experience or BBA student with just a
            degree? There is a higher chance that BVoc students will get selected.
