            Why is BVoc IT(Information Technology) better than other traditional courses?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Let's talk about how this specialization of information technology and computer software
            development of BVoc works. You can’t learn skills like swimming without practical
            experience. If you can't learn swimming by studying on the board, then how can you learn
            coding or programming or software development?
          </p>
          <p>
            Programming has to be done in the company. You can’t learn swimming by just creating
            project reports. Have you created a small HTML project? If you know it theoretically
            then you can pass the exam of BCA or BSC IT, But it will not get you an actual job until
            and unless you do the practice and that's why you should do BVoc in information
            technology where students get practical experience in the form of internships.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s assume that your BCA and MCA has been completed, but you don’t have any practical
            experience so there is no power in coding. That is the reason why 78% of students do not
            get any job and this is not my house number. You can see an Indian skill survey done in
            2021 for reference.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's why you should do BVoc in information technology so that you can get actual
            coding, programming, and software development experience. BVoc provides you with 40%
            theory that you will study in your classroom where industry expert professors are going
            to do very little work in your studies and more in providing opportunities and guidance.
            Those students who are about to go to the company get experience from the company and
            classroom both.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then you have 60% of the Practical experience portion where you have to go to the
            company and collect the knowledge directly from the company. You are a student, you will
            directly become a programmer or an executive in a company, you will pay fees in college
            yourself, and if you are a good coder, you are a good programmer, or at least you learn
            FrontEnd and backend then from the very first year you start earning.

          <h2 class="article__title">Who can do IT(Information Technology) in BVoc?</h2>
          <p>
            Students who after 12th standard have dreams to work in the big IT companies like
            Google,Facebook,Microsoft or internet of things, artificial intelligence, machine
            learning, robotics, programming, coding can do B.Voc in Information Technology or
            Software Computer, Software Development. Students who after 12th standard want to do
            computer engineering, IT engineering, B.C.A etc can do B.Voc in IT which Is better than
            those IT Degrees.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="article">
          <h2 class="article__title">
            Difference between BVoc IT(Information Technology) and BCA OR BSC(IT)
          </h2>
          <p>
            If someone makes a career in Software development or any other IT field like BCA or
            BSC(IT) the student will learn theory from class or do projects or in labs. On the other
            side BVoc IT students will do live internships or on the job training from companies for
            3 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            So now the B.Voc IT student is a graduate with 3 years of company experience and BCA or
            BSC(IT) Student is fresher, Now BCA students do MCA for 2 years and then also he/she
            remains fresher. On the other hand, BVoc students do MVoc or MBA for 2 years and have 5
            years experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now this student thinks after BCA, I should do two years of MCA now and still gain
            knowledge. While BVoc students will do an M.C.A or M.Voc IT course where there will be
            two hours of theory mixed with a full time job in an IT company. He will be able to do a
            job and also start his own IT startup maybe after five years. When these two students go
            for an interview in an IT company then who will be selected? OfCourse the person with
            more experience will be selected. Other than that the most important thing is that a
            BVoc IT student doesn't need to interview in any company as he/she will be selected by
            giving promotion where he is doing internship.

            Is there any Demand of BVoc IT(Information Technology) in future.
          </h2>
          <p>
            B.Voc IT should make a good career because for the next 25 years IT is going to be huge.
            If you are in any industry be it banking or retail industries, now retail has started
            coming online then you will see online stores of D-Mart, Flipkart, Amazon,Myntra and
            everything is going with IT,So That's Why It's a Huge demand because any business now
            includes IT.
