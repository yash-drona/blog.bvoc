            Difference between BVoc IT(Information Technology) and BCA OR BSC(IT)
          </h2>
          <p>
            When someone makes a career in Software development doing BCA or BSC IT the student will
            learn theory from class or do projects or learn in labs. On the other side BVoc IT
            students will learn theory in the classroom as well as do internships or on the job
            training (OJT) in companies for 3 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            A BVoc IT student is graduated with a degree and 3 years of work experience on the other
            hand BCA and BSC IT students are still considered as a fresher. BCA students doing
            Masters for 2 years remain fresher. On the other hand, BVoc students doing master’s for
            2 years have minimum 3-5 years experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            In BVoc 80% students are selected by the company they work in. So they don’t need to go
            for an interview or find a new job after completing BVoc. They can change their company
            for a higher package job or to start their own start-up.
